## Overview

This module allows to: 
- Create a marketplace within on-chain storage.
- Apply to a specific marketplace, uploading documents that will get encrypted in the process.
- Enroll or reject applicants to your marketplace.
- Add or remove users as supported authorities to your marketplace, like administrators and/or asset appraisers
- WIP: Assign a rating to assets as an Appraiser.
- Create sell or buy orders. Users can bid on the item if they don't like the sale price.  

### Terminology
- **Authority**: Refers to any user that has special faculties within the marketplace, like enroll new users or grade assets.
- **Owner**: The authority that created the marketplace, it has the capacity of adding and removing new authorities and enroll or reject applicants. The owner cannot be removed from the marketplace.
- **Administrator**: Like the owner role, it can add or remove new authorities and enroll applicants, with the only difference being that an administrator can be removed from the marketplace.
- **Appraiser**: An authority that can place a rating to the enlisted assets.
- **Redemption Specialist**: This authority is responsible for transforming the on-chain asset into the IRL asset.
- **Application**: The process which a user can submit to a marketplace in order to get enrolled (or rejected). The user needs to upload the necesary documentation, while the marketplace administrator will review it and render a verdict about the users application. The documents will be encrypted and only accesible to the user, the marketplace administrator, and an optional custodian account.
- **Enroll**: When enrolled, the user's application becomes approved, gaining the ability to sell and buy assets.
- **Reject**: If the user gets rejected, its application becomes rejected and won't have access to the marketplace.
- **Custodian**: When submitting an application, the user can optionally specify a third account that will have access to the confidential documents. A custodian doesn't need to be an authority nor being part of the marketplace.
- **Sell order**: The owner of the item creates sales offer fot the item.
- **Buy order**: Users from the marketplace can bid for the item.

## Interface

### Dispachable functions

- `initial_setup` enables all the permission related functionality using the `RBAC` pallet, it can only be called by the sudo account or a majority of the Council (60%). It is essential to call this extrinsic before using other extrinsics.
- `create_marketplace` creates an on-chain marketplace record, it takes a `label` and an account that will fulfill the role of `administrator`, the extrinsic origin will be set up automatically as the marketplace owner.
- `apply` starts the process to enter the specified `marketplace`.
- `reapply` allows the applicant to apply again for the selected marketplace.
- `enroll` is only callable by the marketplace owner or administrator, as it finishes the application process. It takes a `marketplace` identification, and `account` or `application` identification to enroll or reject, and an `approved` boolean flag which approves the application if set to `true`. Owner/admin can add a feedback regarding the user's application.
- `add_authority` is only callable by the marketplace owner or administrator. As it name implies, adds a new user that will have special permission within the marketplace. It takes the `account` which will have the permissions, the type of `authority` it will have, and the `marketplace` identification in which the permissions will be enforced.
- `remove_authority` is only callable by the marketplace owner or administrator. Removes the authority enforcer from the marketplace. The marketplace owner cannot be removed and the administrator cannot remove itself.
- `update_label_marketplace`  is only callable by the marketplace owner or administrator. Changes the marketplace label. If the new label already exists, the old name won't be changed.
- `remove_marketplace`  is only callable by the marketplace owner or administrator. This action allows the user to remove a marketplace as well as all the information related to this marketplace.
- `enlist_sell_offer` is only callable by the owner of the item. It allows the user to sell an item in the selected marketplace. 
- `take_sell_offer` any user interested to buy the item can call this extrinsic. User must have enough balance to buy it. When the transaction is completed, the item ownership is transferred to the buyer. 
- `duplicate_offer` allows the owner of the item to duplicate an sell order in any marketplace. 
- `remove_offer` is only callable by the creator of the offer, it deletes any offer type from all the storages.
- `enlist_buy_offer` is callable by any market participant, the owner of the item can't create buy orders for their own items.  User must have the enough balance to call it. 
- `take_buy_offer` is only callable by the owner of the item. If the owner accepts the offer, the buyer must have enough balance to finalize the transaction.

### Polkadot-js api (javascript library)
While most of the data flow is almost identical to its CLI counter part, the javascript library is much more versatile regarding queries.


#### Submit initial role setup (needs sudo)
```js
const initial_set_up = await api.tx.sudo.sudo(api.tx.gatedMarketplace.initialSetup()).signAndSend(alice);
```

#### Create a marketplace
```js
# Administrator account and marketplace label
const createMarketplace = await api.tx.gatedMarketplace.createMarketplace(bob.address, "my marketplace").signAndSend(alice);
```
#### Get a marketplace
```js
// marketplace_id
const markets = await api.query.gatedMarketplace.marketplaces("0xace33a53e2c1a5c7fa2f920338136d0ddc3aba23eacaf708e3871bc856a34b95");
  console.log(markets.toHuman());
```
```bash
# Output should look like this: 
{ label: 'my marketplace' }
```
```js
// get all marketplaces
const marketplaces = await api.query.gatedMarketplace.marketplaces.entries();
  marketplaces.forEach(([key, exposure]) => {
    console.log('key marketplace_id:', key.args.map((k) => k.toHuman()));
    console.log('     marketplace:', exposure.toHuman(),"\n");
  });
```
```bash
# Output:
key marketplace_id: [
  '0xace33a53e2c1a5c7fa2f920338136d0ddc3aba23eacaf708e3871bc856a34b95'
]
     marketplace: { label: 'my marketplace' }
```

#### Get what roles does an account have on a marketplace
```js
// account_id, pallet_id, scope_id
const rolesByUser = await api.query.rbac.rolesByUser(alice.address,20, "0xace33a53e2c1a5c7fa2f920338136d0ddc3aba23eacaf708e3871bc856a34b95");
  console.log(rolesByUser.toHuman());
```
